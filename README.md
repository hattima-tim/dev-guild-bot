# dev-guild-bot

A discord bot for a server called `Developer's Guild`.

Currently it can:
- Detect if an user reacted to a message with 🔖 in the server.
- Send the reacted message to the user's DM.
> This helps with saving important messages for future use.
- Detect if an user reacted to a message with ❌ in the DM.
- Delete the reacted message.
